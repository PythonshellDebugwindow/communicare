# CommuniCare: Bridging the Medical Communication Gap 

#### According to recent Canadian healthcare statistics, "The national median wait time for all referrals (including urgent) was 78 days, or 11 weeks, with 1 in 4 patients having to wait 175 days (25 weeks) or longer for their specialist appointment."

## Our Inspiration:
As seen by government statistics, the health care industry continues to suffer significantly from inadequate health care professionals to match the population resulting in major dissatification among patients and overworked doctors. Our project, Communicare, strives to overcome this persistent issue through optimization of appointment and diagnosis methods through the asistance of technology and ai. Communicare allows doctors to assign short surveys to patients including and interactive body map to allow them to communicate their situation ahead of the appointment. Additionally, communicare uses ai to help patients communicate their symptoms and convert their organize their information to be more articulate and readable to doctors. This allows doctors to save significant amounts of time on miscommunication.

## Key Features
 - Doctors have a database of their patients and their respective submissions
 - Iteractive, clickable body maps for intuitive symptom communication
 - Images and GIFs, e.g., a coughing animation
