# CommuniCare: Bridging the Medical Communication Gap 

#### "88% of adults have substandard health literacy, 2 and communication failures contribute to over 70% of sentinel events." (Government of US, 2025-Apr-15)

## Inpsiration/Issue:
Children, elders, and non-English speaking patients in the ER often struggle to communicate their symptoms swiftly and articulately, which leads to higher rates of misdiagnosis, delayed treament, and unintended harm. Our project, CommuniCare, enpowers individuals to express their symptoms with interative body diagrams, symptom images, and adaptive AI-powered translations to medical English, tailored to their language and communication abilities. By bridging these gaps in medical communication, we improve safety, equity, and efficiency in urgent care settings. Additionally, it allows patients to refine their explanations before the appointment and communicate online with the doctor to speed up appointments.
