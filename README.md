# CommuniCare: Better communication driving better healthcare

#### Background

Recent Canadian healthcare statistics reveal significant challenges in timely access to medical appointments. The national median wait time for all referrals—including urgent cases—is 78 days (approximately 11 weeks). Disturbingly, 1 in 4 patients wait 175 days (25 weeks) or longer for their specialist appointments.

## Our Inspiration

These stats highlight a critical strain on the healthcare system, impacted by a shortage in supply and demand. The persistent imbalance results in widespread dissatisfaction, delayed diagnoses, and overburdened medical staff. CommuniCare aims to address this issue by leveraging technology and AI to optimize appointment workflows and improve communication between patients and doctors.

By enabling doctors to assign pre-appointment surveys to patients, including intuitive tools such as a clickable body map and symptom checkboxes, CommuniCare helps patients describe their symptoms more clearly before their visit. Our AI-enhanced platform analyzes patient inputs to generate organized, articulate summaries for physicians, helping reduce miscommunication and enabling doctors to make faster, more informed decisions.

## Key Features

- CommuniCare provides a centralised database of patient details and survey submissions for availability among healthcare professionals.
- Doctors can assign surveys to patients before check-ups, which are only accessible to the patient and the doctor.
- Patients use clickable body maps to indicate affected areas, improving symptom localisation.
- They also have access to a quick selection of common symptoms, such as coughing and fever, to streamline information gathering.
- Advanced AI synthesises patient input to provide detailed condition analyses before appointments, facilitating efficient diagnosis.

## What's Next for CommuniCare
1. Integration with professional healthcare technologies and systems.
2. Training AI models specifically for this task to improve clarity, reduce medical workload, and assist in smooth interactions between patients and doctors.
3. Patient-friendly speech recognition tailored for patients with limited literacy or typing skills.
4. Automatic translations from the patient's preferred language into accurate medical English for better diagnosis.
5. Increased diagrams and images to help patients identify and communicate their symptoms better.
6. Visualisation of symptoms through animations to assist patients in selecting the most accurate descriptions of their condition.
